A full stack social media app.

A user must initiate the creation of a chat room with a room size

A user can only send a message to someone else in the same chat room as them

A unblocked user should be notified that their message has been received

A user may be in multiple chat rooms (public and private)

A user can choose to exit one chat room or all chat rooms

At least one of the users in the chat must be the admin

Admin broadcast approved requests of qualified users. Admin monitor users and messages. Admin can ban users and delete messages.

A user creates an account with a profile that includes their age, school, and interests
Age
School (e.g. Rice, Harvard, Duke, Nanjing, Wuhan, etc…)
Interests (e.g. Reading, Sports, Traveling, etc...)

A user can join a public chat room (no special interests) if they are able to join. Admin invite users to join private rooms. The user does not see the chat history of messages sent before they entered the room.

A user will be warned and eventually forcibly banned from all chat rooms if the user uses the phrase “hate speech” in a message.

An unblocked user can send direct or broadcast messages to all users in the chat room

A user can determine who is in the chat room

A user can determine what chat rooms they have joined and what public rooms they can join

When user1 sends a message to user2, user1's message should only appear on user1 and user2's screen. It should not appear on user3's screen.

Messages can contain text, images (emojis)

If message msg2 is sent after message msg1, msg2 should appear on the screen below msg1

If a user leaves a chat room, if should be clear to the other users why the user left (voluntarily left, connection closed, forced to leave).
